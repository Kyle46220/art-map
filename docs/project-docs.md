Of course. Now that the application is implemented, clear documentation is essential. This document will serve as a comprehensive guide for users, developers, and project stakeholders.

Here is a full set of documentation for the "Artverse Navigator" application.

# **Artverse Navigator: Project Documentation**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 21 June 2025
**Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]

## **1. Vision & Introduction**

Artverse Navigator is an interactive web application designed for the exploration and discovery of visual artists. It transforms the traditional, linear process of researching art history into a dynamic and serendipitous visual journey.

The core vision is to help users uncover the hidden threads that connect artists across different eras and movements. By representing these connections as an interactive "mind map" or node graph, the application encourages users to discover new influences, contemporaries, and artistic lineages they might never have found otherwise.

## **2. Features**

  * **AI-Powered Artist Discovery:** Enter the name of any visual artist to begin your exploration.
  * **Interactive Node Graph:** The application dynamically generates a visual network of associated artists.
  * **Dynamic Expansion:** Click on any artist in the graph to make them the new center of exploration, expanding the network with their unique connections.
  * **Visual-First Interface:** Each artist node is populated with a representative image of their work, providing immediate visual context.
  * **Intelligent Connections:** Artist associations are generated by the Google Gemini AI model, providing nuanced connections beyond simple "teacher-student" relationships, including shared themes, styles, and movements.

## **3. How to Use (User Guide)**

Welcome to the Artverse Navigator\! Follow these steps to begin your journey through the world of art.

#### **Step 1: Start Your Journey**

The application opens to a simple search bar. To begin, type the full name of any visual artist you're interested in (e.g., "Frida Kahlo," "Vincent van Gogh," "Takashi Murakami") and press Enter.

#### **Step 2: Explore the Constellation**

Once you submit a name, the magic happens:

  * A central **node** representing your chosen artist will appear. This node will display an image of their work.
  * Connected to this central node, several new artist nodes will appear, each linked by an **edge** (a line).
  * These are the artists that the AI has determined are most closely associated with your initial choice.

#### **Step 3: Expand Your Universe**

The graph is interactive. Click on any of the newly appeared nodes. The application will treat this artist as the new center of focus and perform a new search, spawning a fresh set of related artists connected to it.

You can continue this process indefinitely, building a vast and intricate web of artistic connections. Use your mouse or trackpad to pan around the canvas and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out, allowing you to navigate your unique map of art history.

## **4. Technical Architecture**

This section outlines the technology and data flow that power the Artverse Navigator.

#### **Technology Stack**

  * **Frontend:** React (built with Vite)
  * **Graph Visualization:** Cytoscape.js (via `react-cytoscapejs`)
  * **API Communication:** Axios
  * **Image Handling:** Vite proxy configuration to handle CORS issues with external images

#### **Core Data Flow**

The application operates on a simple but powerful data flow cycle triggered by user interaction:

1.  **User Action:** A user either submits a name in the search bar or clicks on an existing node.
2.  **State Update & API Calls:**
      * The application's state is updated to show a "loading" indicator.
      * Two parallel API calls are initiated for the target artist:
          * **Gemini API:** To fetch a list of associated artists and the context of their connection.
          * **Google Custom Search API:** To fetch a representative image for the artist's node.
3.  **Data Processing:** The responses from the APIs are processed. New nodes are created for each associated artist, and new edges are defined to link them to the central artist.
4.  **Graph Merging:** The newly generated nodes and edges are merged into the existing graph data, carefully avoiding the creation of duplicate nodes and edges.
5.  **UI Re-render:** React detects the state change and re-renders the `GraphCanvas` component, which uses Cytoscape.js to animate the new nodes and edges into view.

**Note:** Images are routed through a Vite proxy configuration to handle CORS restrictions. The current implementation is configured for Saatchi Art images but can be adjusted for other image sources as needed.

### **API Integration Details**

#### **Google Gemini API**

  * **Purpose:** To serve as the "brain" of the application, providing intelligent connections between artists.
  * **Implementation:** A POST request is sent to the Gemini 2.0 Flash API with a carefully engineered prompt. The prompt instructs the model to act as an art historian and return the data *only* in a structured JSON format.
  * **Fallback Behavior:** If the API key is not configured, the application provides a static list of sample artist associations to allow development and testing without requiring immediate API setup.
  * **Prompt Example:**
    ```prompt
    You are an expert art historian API. For the artist "[Artist Name]", generate a list of 5 associated artists. Associations can be direct influence, a shared movement, or a contemporary with a similar style.
    Return the answer ONLY as a valid JSON object with a single key "associations". The value should be an array of objects, where each object has "name" and "connection" keys.
    Do not include any text before or after the JSON object. Do not use markdown formatting.
    ```

#### **Google Custom Search API**

  * **Purpose:** To source a relevant image for each artist node created.
  * **Implementation:** A GET request is sent to the Custom Search API endpoint. The search query is formatted as `"[Artist Name] artwork"` to improve the relevance of results. The API is configured to search the entire web and return image results. The URL of the first image result is used for the node background.
  * **Fallback Behavior:** If API credentials are not configured or an error occurs, the application will use placeholder images with the artist's name to ensure the interface remains functional during development or when API limits are reached.

## **5. Getting Started (For Developers)**

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

#### **Prerequisites**

  * Node.js (v18 or later)
  * `npm` or `yarn` package manager

#### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd artverse-navigator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

#### **Configuration**

The application requires API keys to function.

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project directory.

2.  Add the following environment variables to the file, replacing the placeholder text with your actual keys:

    ```bash
    # .env.local

    # Get from Google AI Studio
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

    # Get from Google Cloud Console
    VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY"
    VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="YOUR_PROGRAMMABLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
    ```

#### **Running the Application**

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL provided in your terminal).

## **6. Future Enhancements**

  * **Information Side Panel:** Clicking a node or edge could display more detailed information (artist bio, connection context) in a side panel.
  * **Save & Share:** Functionality to save a user's generated graph or share a link to it.
  * **Customizable Layouts:** Allow users to switch between different graph layouts (e.g., grid, circle, concentric).
  * **Era/Movement Filtering:** Add filters to show only artists from a specific time period or art movement.
